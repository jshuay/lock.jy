I have been running Ubuntu natively on my laptop for 4 years now. To me, the appeal of a Linux system is the ability for me to highly customize my system, especially with my own programs. This is one such program that I had always been very interested in making. It is a quick way to lock/unlock my laptop through the use of a SD card (or any USB for that matter).
